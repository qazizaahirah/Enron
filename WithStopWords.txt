John,
Attached is the base curve we used to value the ACE (Ahlstrom plant in CA) as 
of Nov 10,2000.  

What I am looking for is this:

What would be the cost to buy the following four put options,
assuming financial settle 
 volume of 10,000 MMBtu/day ,
settled at Socal,
Option term of 2001-2002 :

Monthly Put option, strike price based on the curve in the attached 
spreadsheet (Nov 10 curve)
Same as above but strike is at the market.
Annual put option, strike price based on the curve in the attached 
spreadsheet (Nov 10 curve).
Annual put option but with strike at the market.

Last week I got bids from Phillips which were ($0.02) and ($0.03) for Socal 
basis for 2001 and 2002, respectively.  We will likely need to update these 
numbers.
Here is the 2000 10 Flash Report.  Let me know if there are any questions.



Thank you,
Amy
ext 39741The gas book liquidated twice, so our QTD and YTD was understated.  I 
manipulated west hedge to back off the liquidation, and then had to bring the 
west hedge new balance into  DPR 11/30, which also impacted DPR 12/01, and 
DPR 12/04. 

In numbers, LT books QTD and YTD increased on 11/30  by approximately 1.1mm 
to $4,238,083 and $477,795,999 respectively.  That increase had to flow 
through to the 12/01 and 12/04 post hoc.  I re-published and re-exported 
11/30 and 12/01 using the Report files for 11/30, 12/01.

As an aside, Life To Date westhedge numbers are not completely incorporated 
into the 11/30 through current DPRs, so I will continue to address the Life 
To Date until it is fixed.T O D A Y    G O D    I S    F I R S T

Being an Overcomer

I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace.
In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have
overcome the world.
- (John 16:33)


"Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise
find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those
who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to
be true?" This was the comment from a business associate
recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not
a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to
maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother
sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, "Why do the
wicked prosper?" (see Jer. 12:1)

It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the
Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised
Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the
Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is
not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to
honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition
from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us
must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit
and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.

Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer
than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake
among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and
ineffective.

Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from
walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory
for every battle you will encounter. Call on His name.

If you encounter any errors please contact the resolution center @ 
713-853-1411 Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Subject: FYI call approx. 1.5 weeks ago from Madelon Coover @ AGENCY

Jay/Dave - as I mentioned Madelon Coover called approx. a week and a half ago 
trying to get in our good books (or in her words 'resurrect our 
relationship').  

The only two things she said of any interest were the following:

- they have developed a WAP/ Palm(?) prototype in Dallas that enables some 
degree of EnronOnline quotes to this platform (not sure of functionality) - 
she was clearly keen to show this to us (I did not commit us in any way ) 

- she also mentioned their Portland office is doing work for EBS , something 
to do with broadband and that they were 'very happy with their work'.




Richard - do we have a policy regarding questions concerning pending 
litigation?  How should we handle these?

Subject: FAQ's regarding Agency.

Mark,

I would appreciate your comments on the following FAQ's, intended to be a 
guide for Louise/myself/PR in the event we take a media call regarding the 
injunction/lawsuit. Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please 
let me know.


Any calls received from the media will be answered by Louise, or in Louise' 
absence, by myself, with PR in the room (Louise will be back in the office on 
Monday and I suspect it is very unlikely that we would receive any calls 
before then).

Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline?
A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of 
EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff.

Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Agency was involved in developing.

Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Enron developed.

Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency?
A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without 
authorisation from Enron.

Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit?
A We are not releasing that information at this time.

Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged 
the competitive lead of EnronOnline?
A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the 
terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information 
is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined.

Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies?
A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which 
can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the 
actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very 
capable IT consultancy companies.

Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided?
A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but 
are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual 
contributors.

Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other 
companies looking to build something like EnronOnline?
A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com.

Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information 
into a public forum.
A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our 
contractor does not seem to have been upheld.

Q11 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction?
A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information.

Q12  If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you 
also filing a lawsuit?
A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is 
found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has 
already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate.










Here is the information regarding the presentation done by AGENCY.COM.

The BEA Users Conference is being held in San Francisco, CA 2/21-2/24.
The conference has over 2,000 registered users representing many types of 
companies.
About the Session and Presentation
On Wednesday, February 23 at 11:00 an hour long session was to open to any 
registered conference attendee.
Around 200 (very rough guess) people attended the session.
The session was moderated by Scott Dietzen, CTO BEA Server Division and was 
described as 
'Web E-Commerce Solutions: Using Best of Breed Technologies'.
The session included 4 panel members from Calico Commerce (an ISV), Idea 
Integration 
(an integrator), Cygent (an ISV) and AGENCY.COM.
Each of the 4 panel members gave a 12 minute presentation then the session 
was turned over
for general questions and answers.
Joe Tatem of AGENCY.COM went last and spoke about the web development 
marketplace: where 
it was and where it needed to head.
Like the other panel members he described his company and gave a little sales 
pitch for 
BEA Weblogic.
Tatem then presented a case study as an example of some of their work.
This example was of AGENCY.COM's work for Enron on EnronOnline.
His case study consisted of 2 slides.
The first slide had screen images of EnronOnline: one was the EnronOnline 
home page and the 
second was the quotes page populated with some products.
The quotes page was 'overlayed' on the home page and obscured the EnronOnline 
banner on the 
bottom so that only the 'ne' at the end showed.
The Enron logo (the counter-clockwise 45-degree logo was clearly visible. 
He talked about it being a Trading Extranet site but said he could not name 
the customer.
He described that real time prices for products were being displayed to 
customers.
He then showed the next slide which gave a high level overview of the 
application 
architecture for EnronOnline.
This slide contains details about real time server (RTServer) and its 
associated 
application server (including the RMI communication mechanism).
He made a comment about how they were particularly proud of the real time 
piece and how it 
was designed and how it worked.
This slide also contained a reference to the fact EnronOnline uses Oracle 8i.
He also mentioned Jesica as the content management piece and indicated that 
they were 
looking at other 3rd party products to replace that in their future projects.
This slide also contains a reference to StackManager and he indicated that it 
was developed 
by the unamed client and not by AGENCY.COM.
He also talked about ShockWave plugin being used in the browser to receive 
the 
real time quotes.
Only one question was asked from the audience during his showing of the 
technical 
architecture slide.
This question (paraphrased) was: When you use RMI between the web server and 
the 
app server how many connections do you use.
He replied (paraphrased): one per thread.
The questioner then asked something else that I assumed was a technical 
detail about how 
WebLogic RMI worked.
Tatem replied incorrectly and a BEA employee responded with the right answer.
About the Handouts of the Presentation
BEA tried to make available hard copies of all presentation slides in each 
session.
They setup a series of shelves that were numbered for each session.
The documents were available starting Monday during the registration process 
and 
throughout the conference.
On Monday evening I went to pick up hard copies of the sessions for which I 
was interested.
About a third of the handouts for the sessions were not available.
I did not notice whether the one for above mentioned presentation was 
available. (I did 
not expect it to one of the more interested ones.)
During some of the sessions BEA handed out copies to those present.
I did not see any handed out during the above mentioned session.
After the session was over I called Jay Webb and told him of the above 
details.
After telling Jay I saw Scott Dietzen from BEA in the hallway. (I had met him 
twice before.)
I told Dietzen that the presentation that AGENCY.COM did in his panel was 
about Enron. 
(We had already discussed the project with Dietzen when he visited our 
Houston office.)
I told him that AGENCY.COM was not supposed to reveal any information 
concerning the 
project.
At this time I did not know that hard copies of the presentation were 
available. I told 
Dietzen that if they did become available that the portion about EnronOnline 
should not 
be distributed.
Dietzen said he was not aware of the problem with discussing the project. He 
apologized 
and said he would not distribute any handouts if he received them.
Sometime later on Wednesday I went to the rack of presentation handouts and 
there was 
one available for the above mentioned session.
I do not know how long they were available (and I don't think Dietzen did 
either).
There were only 2 or 3 copies left and I took all of them. (BEA usually put 
out many 
copies in the rack so I don't know how many were actually picked up.)
The hard copies are PowerPoint printouts that include room for notes so the 
slides are 
very small making it difficult to read.
When the slides were shown on the screen during the session they were very 
clear.

Also, during some of the sessions (not the one where AGENCY.COM presented) I 
attended 
there was some question about the availability of the handouts and someone 
from BEA would 
answer something about the web.
I assumed that at some point in the near future they might be making copies 
of the 
presentations available on the BEA web site.
I will try to confirm this tomorrow (Thursday).
I checked the web site a few minutes ago and the presentations are not there. 

I will followup with any more details if I remember something else or if 
there are any 
further developments.

Thanks,
Kevin Montagne

																														NYMEX to Launch Online Trading Next Spring
																														
																														
																														
																														?  The NYMEX plans to launch its online trading platform, enymex, in  the 
second quarter of next year. The system will trade and clear  forward 
contracts for physical commodities such as crude oil,  refined products, 
natural gas, electricity and metals. It will  compete with existing ventures 
such as IntercontinentalExchange and  HoustonStreet. Enymex was originally 
set to start in the third  quarter of this year. NYMEX had been in talks on 
joining ICE before  deciding to go it alone.

 - img38.gifThe 2000 Chairman's Award nomination process was a tremendous success!  From 
around the world, over 425 nominations were received representing a broad 
cross-section of our overall organization and resulting in a 73% increase in 
nomination participation from last year.  This 100% employee-driven program 
is so successful because you take time to nominate and recognize those 
individuals that are special in your work life.  Every single candidate is to 
be congratulated!  

This year, the original concept was brought to fruition when the members of 
the 1999 Chairman's Roundtable took over the selection process and carried 
the torch from past to present.  This Selection Committee reviewed all 
candidates on the basis of their ability to consistently bring our values to 
life and sought out those select few that are Enron's "everyday heroes".  

It is with great pleasure that we announce the 2000 Chairman's Roundtable 
whose daily pursuit of excellence, commitment to communication, genuine 
integrity and respect for others are what make Enron the incredible company 
that it is today - innovative, successful and undoubtedly one of the best 
places to work.  The eleven individuals named below are flying to San Antonio 
this from around the world to be honored at our annual Management 
Conference.  One of these finalist will receive the distinguished recognition 
as the actual Chairman's Award winner:

Attached is a list of every employee who was nominated for the Chairman's 
Award this year:



Please take a moment to recognize this honor bestowed upon your fellow 
employees.  We sincerely thank them for their contributions to Enron and 
their leadership that helps make this organization the world,s leading energy 
and communications company.   If you have any questions regarding this year's 
program or suggestions for the future, please contact Charla Reese at

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR

rate is less than

Dear Sir or Madam :

 Enron Corp. (&Enron8) believes in conducting its business affairs in 
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of 
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a

consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or 
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your 
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects 
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that 
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department will 
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and 
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical 
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length 
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations.

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the 
capacity 
and shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on

original shipper. 

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In 
addition 
to the Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric charge, the

? 

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation 
capacity for electronic bid ("package or packages"): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available transportation capacity under the specified package OR 
multiple 
rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation 
capacity under the specified package.? If the same Shipper submits multiple 
bids, 
the highest present value for such package of available transportation 
capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for 
the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is 
less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x 
FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the 
maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest 
Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied 
shipper 
will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an improved bid within 
24 
hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed to (801) 
584-7076 
to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still exists, such capacity 
shall 
be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than 
indicated for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

UPCOMING DECEMBER? SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE 

*** November 27, 2000 - December 15, 2000 

20" Camas - Eugene Pigging Project 

Due to permit issues imposed by the City of Gresham, anomaly repair work on 
the 20" Camas - Eugene line has been delayed from the original repair date of 
October 23 & October 31, 2000, until the week of November 27, 2000 through 
December 15, 2000.? It is not known at this time if any pipeline anomalies 
will require repair. The 20" Camas to Eugene is paralleled by a 30" / 20" 
loop line and no impacts are anticipated at this time.


*** November 10, 2000 - December 8, 2000 

Vernal Pigging Project 

WGP-W crews continue to excavate and repair anomalies between mainline valve 
2-7 
(M.P. 213) to mainline valve 2-10 (M.P. 263). Based on current data, it is 
not known how 
many pipeline anomalies will require repair.? Gas outages may be required 
during this period 
and will be communicated as quickly as the information becomes available.

Subject: Sta. 20 Suction Pressures

Darrell,  Attached is a history (last 365 days) of the suction pressures of 
Station 20 arranged in descending order.  In a nutshell, we looked at the 
minimum pressure (492 psig), calculated the pressure drop (34# at 54.4 
MMcf/d) on the proposed 6.6 miles of 12" to get 458 psig at the upstream side 
of the regulator.  Typically we would like to have a 50# differental across 
the regulator, which would give us 408 psig downstream of regulation.  I 
believe you were needing 435 psig.

 

Looking at the it in reverse, 435 psig + 50 psig across reg =  485 psig, 
calculate pressure drop (31 psig), we would need 516 psig at the suction of 
Station 20.  Note there are only 8 days during the last year where the 
pressure was lower than 516 psig or 97.8% of the time.

Please call me if you would like to discuss further or would like to meet.

John,

I met with Ben regarding the Precedent Agreement this evening.  He had the 
following questions/comments:

1. "...Shipper's power plant construction by August 1, 2001, then either 
Party may terminate this Precedent Agreement by providing the other Party 
written notice of such termination.  ; provided that such right to terminate 
must be exercised on or before August 3, 2001.  In any event, unless the 
Shipper provides written notice to Transco on or before August 3, 2001 that 
it will enter into a Service Agreement , the Precedent Agreement will 
terminate automatically.

2. Can we make the Guaranty effective after August 3, 2001 if we do not 
terminate the Precedent Agreement?

3. In talking to Gerald Nemec, it also occurred to me that we need to 
determine any balance sheet effects of the Guaranty in relationship to this 
project.  I will check on this tomorrow and let you know.


Thanks.

	Our vision to become The World's Leading Company positions our company for 
great success this year and beyond.  Our success is dependent on execution.  
With that in mind, we are making Enron's 2001 corporate and business unit 
goals available to employees.  

Please take a few minutes to review our 2001 goals on Enron's intranet at 
http://172.28.92.190/bowne/    We believe they will help you gain a better 
understanding of our vision for the company and will inspire you to identify 
innovative ways to help your organization and Enron achieve our objectives.  
We have a lot to accomplish this year, and with your hard work and 
dedication, we can realize another year of stellar performance.John,

I'm an analyst in the Generation Investments group, and we spoke regarding 
the Navy Yard transport curves about a month ago.

I am assuming there is probably no change in the applicable transport curves, 
but I just wanted to verify that there are no updates.

I have attached our past letters of correspondence regarding your suggestions 
for marking our transport expenses for the project.

Thanks,
Greg

Subject: Re: Brooklyn Navy Yard Project Transportation Curves Request  

Attached is a spreadsheet that details the transportation charges that you 
requested.  I recommend escalating the Iroquois and Transco charges in the 
same way as was done previously.  Escalate 18% of the Iroquois rates at the 
GDP inflator and 36% of the Transco rates.  This will take into account the 
pipeline's O&M cost increases.  TCPL is a different case.  Since we last 
looked at the Brooklyn Naval Yard assets, TransCanada has negotiated a 
settlement with its customers.  These are the rates that begin in 1/1/2002 on 
the spreadsheet.  However, TCPL is experiencing an inordinate amount of 
capacity turnback.  As their customer's contracts expire, the customers are 
not renewing.  This shoves their rate base on fewer and fewer customers and 
should increase their rates more quickly.  The next large customer turnback 
should occur in 2003.  For this reason, I recommend escalating TCPL's rates 
by 20% in 2003 and then escalating the entire rate by the GDP in the future.  
This should not only take into account the capacity turnback, but also 
consider the escalation in O&M costs.  Call me if you have any questions.

Hi, John,

Following up my phone call, I am sending a list of curve requests for you on 
the BNY project:

Base Year: 2001

1. Trans Canada:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation  
2. Iroquois:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation 
 3. Transco Z1 - Z6:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation  

On the Tariff escalation part, based on your inputs, we used 22%, 18%, and 
36% of GDP inflation for TransCanada, Iroquois and Transco, respectively.  
Also, you estimated % increase in Transco Tariff from 2001 to 2007.  

Thanks a lot for your help!

Good morning,

I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to update you regarding the
Homestead Expansion Precedent Agreements (PA's) status.  As I presented in my
letter to you last month, I expected to be in a position to distribute the 
PA's
this week.  However, that schedule was fairly aggressive and TCO Homestead
project team is currently in the process of completing some critical analysis
that we need to support our recommendations to TCO management.  TCO will
distribute the PA's as soon as TCO management has reviewed and approves the
recommendations made by the Homestead project team.  At this time, I am not
expecting any significant delay and remain hopeful that TCO will be able to
distribute the PA's during the week ending Friday, April 13.  (I am not
superstitious!)  I apologize for any inconvenience this unexpected delay may
cause you.  Please call your account manager or me if you have any questions 
or
special needs related to the Homestead PA's.  Thank you for your patience and
support of this project.  I look forward to working with you in the near
future.


Best Regards,

Michael Strauss
703.227.3364The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.Here's the list with the changes you gave me...

As discussed on Monday, Enron Canada has agreed to restructure its "Boston 
Gas" agreements with Encal Energy so that Encal will become the shipper of 
record for a portion of the TGP and Iroquois capacity.  They in turn  will 
release back  to ENA for one year each April.  There should be no disruption 
to the East Desk business other than they will have additional contracts to 
manage for the same net volume.

These are the precise releases we would like you to initiate.  What we need 
to know as soon as possible is what if any credit requirements from Encal 
that the pipelines will require.

John,
Attached is the base curve we used to value the ACE (Ahlstrom plant in CA) as 
of Nov 10,2000.  

What I am looking for is this:

What would be the cost to buy the following four put options,
assuming financial settle 
 volume of 10,000 MMBtu/day ,
settled at Socal,
Option term of 2001-2002 :

Monthly Put option, strike price based on the curve in the attached 
spreadsheet (Nov 10 curve)
Same as above but strike is at the market.
Annual put option, strike price based on the curve in the attached 
spreadsheet (Nov 10 curve).
Annual put option but with strike at the market.

Last week I got bids from Phillips which were ($0.02) and ($0.03) for Socal 
basis for 2001 and 2002, respectively.  We will likely need to update these 
numbers.

	"How to Kill A  Blonde"
	
	Score: 65
	(posted by Shella on  07/31/00)
	
	One Day, A Blonde walks into a hair salon with  headphones on. The 
Hairstylist said:  
	
	"What would you like done today?"  
	
	The Blonde Answered..."I want to get my hair permed."  
	
	"Well, you're gonna have to remove those headphones first."  answered the 
hairstylist.  
	
	"But I can't! My parents said that if I EVER take them off, I'll  die!" The 
Blonde said  
	
	"Alright, I'm gonna go get the stuff I need, and when I come  back, you 
better have those off." the hairstylist replied. So as she  was walking into 
the backroom, the blonde appempted to take off the  headphones.  
	
	When the hairstylist returned, she found the blonde sprawled out  on the 
floor. She was dead. The hairstylist picked up the headphones  that were 
laying next to her. There was a voice on the headphones  saying:  
	
	"Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in,  Breathe 
out."

 - instant.gifNewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.comJennifer,
I just checked with Carolyn on your invoicing for the conference.  She 
verified the 85K was processed.

posted to The Woodlands House account.
* ACCOUNTING: Please fax Jeff the back up for the package handling
charges. $451.35
* ACCOUNTING: Please adjust (1) wireless mouse charge for a total of
$156.41
* JEFF: In regards to the lunch charges, we charged a day guest rate
to include lunch in The Woodlands Dining Room @ $57.00 for  40 day
attendees.  You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package.  However,
when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box
lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.  Thus, 80+40=120 - 100
(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The
Woodlands Dining Room.  We billed you for the total amount of persons over
the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.
* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.  Enron had a guarantee of
120 attendees.  We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.  This particular
day, (5) breakouts were ordered.  The audio visual in the additional
breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.
Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.

Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as
possible in order to remit for payment.  Please feel free to call me should
you have further questions.  Thank you for your business!

Jennifer,
In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97 
figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference.  However, after 
speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case.  The CDs are not 
included in this figure.  

The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is 
currently being tabulated).

Hi,

This is the original quote for this project and it did not include the 
postage. As soon as I have the details from the vendor, I'll forward those to 
you.
Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Shweta.

		 Subject: Quotes for the CD's.

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's)   - $ 355.00
     This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing 
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included. 
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming - 
$ 770.00

So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8 
days. These are approximate figures only.

If you have any questions you can call Karen Hunter at X56228. or I can be 
reached at X55706.

Thanks,
Shweta.

Attached is the newest EBS orgchart, updated 2 days ago.  They have made some 
interesting changes.


Also, you can click on the URL below to go to the EBS intranet site, where 
you will find all sorts of information related to EBS, its market and 
competition, etc.  As a "high-tech" company, they actually do keep this 
updated very frequently, unlike some of the other Enron internal web sites.

JeffKim,

I would like to either meet with you, or trade e-mails on your current and 
possible future target accounts list where GSS may be able to add value to 
your efforts.  Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I 
want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may 
not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team 
have requested our involvement with.  I also want to make sure I'm bringing 
resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.

For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent 
developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received 
from the NYC office re:  Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, 
where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be 
with one of their medical groups based in Chicago.  After several 
unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant 
category.  Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement 
with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and 
today American Express has surfaced.  Consequently, I think it's probably a 
good idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you.  

I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would 
work?  If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or any 
time on December 27th, 28th, or 29th.  When would be good for you?  Please 
let me know!

Thank you,

Jeff

JohnI want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, 
Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an 
issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are 
okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone.

Thanks for the inquiry.  I sincerely appreciate you giving me the heads up.  
As much as it pains me to say yes, I think John has proved himself worthy and 
I am willing to let him interview for the job.  As we talked about before, my 
only condition is that you guys make sure you are willing to take him if he 
comes out on top.  If there is any chance that his past will negatively 
influence your decision, I am not willing to let him interview.  He handled 
the last experience with real maturity, but I do not want him to have any 
more reasons to doubt his ability to overcome his past by working hard and 
proving himself here.  He is very valuable to me and ENA.  Please let me 
know.

Jennifer, 

This is apparently the type of deal flip-flop which BMC has been blessing EBS 
with.  In the note from Doug Cummins which contained his updated spend 
projections, he had the "Professional Services" highlighted with a bunch of 
question marks.  It is at the bottom of his sheet, and lists a qty of 30 @ 
$2000 per = $60,000 --- I assume that's $2K/hour or per day.  Either way, 
it's not something that appears palatable to them (Net Works).  I'll be going 
over there in a few minutes, and will try to check w/each of the guys.  I'll 
keep you posted.

Clarification on the below.

Point #1 our position has been $3MM on software (they are saying they need 
$4MM to get the deal done.)

Additionally, they want Maintenance and professional services to go with the 
dollar amount.  $2.4MM is their position here.  I need your help to clarify 
with each group who is on board with maintenance and profesional services.  
BMC's #2 guy Jeff Hawn told Jim Crowder this was critical for them.

Jeff,

Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal.  We are making real progress.  
Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  
$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  
No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3.  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron?  
Not sure what you mean here
4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?
We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will work


Please let me know if you have any other questions.  I will call you tomorrow 
to touch base.

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the

I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of

of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I 
found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no 
minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the 
lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.

Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on 
what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And 
when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the 
information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the

Subject: fund views

Hi- all the funds are trying to figure out what the play is for next year- 
major divergence of opinions.  Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.

+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the 
perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no 
industrial (basic industry type) can operate.  He tracks all the plant 
closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a 
more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track 
this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic 
conditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total number 
for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does 
not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for 
the summer.

While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels
He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) 
based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally 
think that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is tracking 
these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q 
over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.

He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, 
crude/propane....

+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 
storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the 
backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower 
baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am torn 
on this one.

+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same 
analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long 
nat gas!! through vol or outright.

+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas 
just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM 
issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. 

+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: 
Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance 
(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, 
I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

Have a great holiday!  I'll be here next week.

Caroline

Hey:
Sorry I didn't get to come by before I left. I have been in London since 
12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday 
season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)
 Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I 
suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, 
Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he 
should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. 
Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a 
large role in turning the crude and products group around. 

 Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of 
good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the 
gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products 
(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I 
think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together.

Happy New Year!
Jen

Stewart,

Per our phone conversation, Universal is looking for sponsorship funds to 
grow JPI (Jurassic Park Institute).

Enron Media has an opportunity (perhaps) to provide advertising risk 
management services beyond their Motion Picture Group, to their Music, Home 
Video and Recreation Groups.

There may be an opportunity for EBS to provide bandwidth in lieu of 
sponsorship dollars or some other type of arrangement.

I am trying to reschedule my meeting with their motion picture advertising 
team for the second week in January, so I'll stay in touch to see if you 
develop an opportunity through their global sourcing group.

the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just 
not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of 
demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we 
gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground 
and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, 
distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be "substantial."  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"
Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Mosey
said.

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know

John,
As we discussed earlier, ENA HR is working with the A/A program to develop a 
process for placing sr. spec into associate titles.  Unfortunately, that 
process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.  
Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to 
interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.  

Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in 
similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to 
be held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of these 
consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this 
discussion.  I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until 
after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the 
title change.  Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest 
convenience.  If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   I 
apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.  Please 
contact me with any questions/concerns.

Sarah-Joy...
I just picked up your voice mail...

I am forwarding Byron Gaddis's e-mail in response to your question of who
PCC is working with at EES.

Let me stress that I am not working with anyone other than John (and now
hopefully you) at Enron to get PCC Ball Valves approved for international
use at Enron.

I am providing Byron Gaddis' e-mail address as he is in Portland at Corp HQ,
and is familiar with the issue. He may be able to provide a name for you at
EES that PCC is working to conclude an agreement on energy....note that the
activity is covered under a Conf Agreement to protect PCC and its data. In
addition, Byron was curious about your possible need for blades and the
mechanism you go through to acquire them.

As for me... we would like you to fall in love with our world class ball
valves from PCC Ball Valves (hence putting them on the approved supplier
list) AND also love our Emergency Shutdown Systems for pipelines by our
Barber Industries (again, feeling so smitten that they find their way onto
your approved list)... John has the information packages on both companies
and product lines...

For me... signing off from Milan Italy...where I have been living and
breathing these ball valves this week. Shipments of 40" and 48" units going
to Transgaz on a Romanian/ Russian pipeline as well as 36" units for a
Turkish pipeline are going out....

I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  I 
did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to 
Jenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's 
retraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very 
"customer-focused" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to 
the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!

Not that it matters but wanted you to know:
BMC rep left message recanting the fact that we would still have the 45 % 
discount if SAP modules were purchased at some other time.  He states now 
that if not purchased now the discount would only be 10-20 % range at a later 
date.

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

	Jennifer,

Thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday. Sorry I had to leave but I had to
meet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information
exchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a
different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.

Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some
things are very clear in our go forward strategy.

At the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff,
myself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If
corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the
account. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved
the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.
That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are
taking place within Enron.  He isn't the decision maker on deals like the
EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other
business opportunities within Enron. Dave's sole responsibility is Enron and
making sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in
making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the
relationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to
make sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go
around him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total
picture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how
those situations can impact the business at and for Enron.

Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts
with Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the
sixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per
year. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.
So at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let's
make sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I
received this data from.

 <<RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.>>  <<RE: Enron Building
Services Novi MI.>>

Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level
set very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive
light. Compaq will honor it's commitments but we need to make sure that
Enron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of
expectations relative to Compaq's revenue from EBS versus what actually got
booked. Our expectations were $96M a year  based on the forecast provided by
EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday).  I find it
very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held
accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don't have the revenue to
off set it.  Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based
on expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to
see how it was left.   I also need to get your perspective on the
transaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity,  Compaq certainly
wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it's equitable for
both sides.   I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get
through it.


Jennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and
hosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.
Thanks,

I agree.  Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about 
this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward.  I'd 
definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall 
commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply 
in the very near future.  I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with 
HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless 
decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, 
and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably 
linked.  Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more 
recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg 
understand that his focus was different than ours.  

Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process.  I have 
certainly found her involvement invaluable.

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager

(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.


Appreciate it.

Sarah-JoyLooks like we are dead in the water based on this message and the one Glenn

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - Quest is so far ahead 
technology-wise and cheaper.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be the best and would 
purchase it now if the other group was willing to cooperate.  I believe Jim 
Ogg wants to evaluate more tools and related design tools before making a 
decision.

Regards,
Douglas


Chaz and Steve,

Here's the latest, in a nutshell.  Basically, the testing is not fully 
completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is 
also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the 
purchase decision).  As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out 
on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas.  
However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to 
surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation.

In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with 
the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at 
EBS.  The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema 
Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, 
especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation.  

Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential 
vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC 
purchase at this point.  I will be on vacation next week, but will be 
checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th.  Jennifer or I will keep 
you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.

I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to 
me.  The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net 
Works teams in question:  more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales 
opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your 
deal done.  The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from 
yesterday still apply.

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor's 
solution is a better one for us.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be an excellent 
product, and would consider it to be a viable option for purchase.  I believe 
Net Works will still evaluate more similar tools, and related design tools, 
before making a decision.

Jennifer:

If you are referring to the Wireless call, I was on the call and actively 
participated with Peter G.  I had the agenda discussion items and  guided the 
conversation. The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G. to discuss 
wireless initiatives briefly. Then Peter G. literally read from my notes the 
"message" you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both 
the buy and sell sides.  

The call went well, message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP 
so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative.

Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy (but not Gerry Cashiola) were on the call.  Greg 
Pyle made a note of saying that HP realized that they were going to have to 
fully support the process on both the buy and sell sides.

I will still connect back with Greg Pyle by phone.

Everett and Jim,

I have phone calls into both of you to gain your feedback and support on 
appropriate next steps with Compaq.   Everett, I am asking for your input as 
it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the 
relationship owners.  During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :
 a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately 
(his replacement has yet to be named).  My perception is that Keith took the 
hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales 
projections.   EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected 
targets.  
 b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his 
existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server 
Agreement 
 c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS 
Services.   For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed 
at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 
8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters.  EBS sent 
Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th.   Compaq has not paid the 
invoice.  Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying 
Compaq.  Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay.  Bob stated that 
EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and 
Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS 
services (Bob's first negotiation position).   
 d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in 
the EBS Server Spend amount.    
  Compaq (Bob Jordan) value  - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and 
hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)    - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million 
for servers and hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 
1999
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional 
services (costs for Server deployment)

 From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the 
following might occur
  EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000  at 8% would equal a Compaq 
purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)
  Compaq total is $5.1 million spend  at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase 
amount of $408,000
  EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount 
is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) 

 e) 2000 income.   Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had 
to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could 
defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 
2002.  If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the 
right to spend against the amount.  To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS 
worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS 
consulting services provided to Compaq.   Again, under Keith M's stewardship 
- they verbally agreed to pay. 

Now with the above information - my offered next steps :
 a) Until everything is done - maintain the "stick" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 
million).  This is being done.
 b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee.   It 
does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages.  Prior 
conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee 
(again with Keith M).   This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. 
 c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on 
services of $4.1 million.   This is a good return for a commodity 
transaction.  So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier 
relationship.   

 So...... please let me know your thougths.   We have countered with the $2.5 
million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.  

Please let me know your thoughts

713-345-6133 - Office
713-646-6313Mr. Shankman:

In preparation for the meeting on December 11th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the 
Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  We would 
appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.

Background:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year 
with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic 
Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader,  to review the strong 
business relationship in fuel management and travel services which  Enron has 
had with Continental Airlines.  Discussions were held as to how this 
relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.

A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both 
companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to 
expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in 
weather derivatives and plastics hedging.

December 11th Meeting Purpose:  Follow-up from October 25th meeting to 
specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th 
meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude:  (1) fuel management, 
(2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.

Location:  Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his 
availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor.  If he can make it for 
a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he 
is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 
Smith Street.  Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific 
preference?

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, 
we have coordinated through John Nowlan.  At the October 25th meeting,  Alan 
Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather 
derivatives opportunities, respectively.  

Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines  Enron's 
current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed 
initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging.  Larry 
Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing 
input on this.

Sarah-Joy,
Here is an update per your request.

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

I spoke to John briefly this morning.  Fed-Ex (Memphis) has not been in 
contact with our legal all last week.  John supports our move today to begin 
moving business to UPS.  I have left a message to Carmen to call me ASAP.  My 
message is to inform her of our movement of significant corporate office 
business beginning today. I have every expecation that Carmen will call me 
back this afternoon.  Since the discussions aren't happening, I doubt that we 
will be flying to Memphis, but I'll advise of any changes as they occur.


Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.

Greg,

 I really appreciated the time you spent with Derryl and I last week.  It was 
an excellent start to developing the significant opportunities that will 
benefit both GSS and NEPCO.  I look forward to continuing to work with you to 
deliver value to the NEPCO bottom line.

 I have attached meeting minutes from last Thursday's meeting, including 
action items for some of the areas we discussed.  One of the action items is 
to set a follow up in January for a GSS analytical team to gather data in 
your offices, and to begin developing specific supply strategies.  I met with 
the other SPLs this morning and identified the team members we would plan to 
send.  At the moment we would like to target January 30th and 31st for our 
follow-up.  I will work with the team to develop a specific agenda for that 
visit and will forward it to you by January 8th.

 Please let me know if you have any additions, deletions or changes to the 
attached minutes. 

        Happy Holidays,
        
        Roy Hartstein

David and Bob,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS 
relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities 
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  
After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin 
as the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from 
Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith 
McAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending 
additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business 
opportunities and issues.  

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop 
the streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th 
meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product 
and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media 
solutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the 
intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these 
solutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the 
appropriate next steps to further our relationship.  

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework 
for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until 
those changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq 
was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 
7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice 
amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 
on or before December 31,2000.   
2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, 
Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   
The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written 
notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a 
new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  
EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if 
Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we 
look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create 
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Brad,
As you are aware, Enron has recently signed an agreement with Corestaff for 
temporary staffing services.  Our group, Global Strategic Sourcing Business 
Development, is now working with Corestaff from a cross-sell prospective.  
Corestaff has a contract with MCI for broadband services that will be coming 
up this year for renegotiation.  In the coming month, we would like to 
facilitate a meeting with the EBS contacts you determine and the Corestaff IT 
contacts.

Nationally, Corestaff has 100 offices and its parent company, The Corporate 
Services Group, has 348 offices located in Great Britain, France and Spain.  
For your reference, I've also included the original all-Enron e-mail 
regarding the Corestaff alliance.

		 Subject: Improved Process for Engaging Temporary Workers
  Cindy Olson  Executive VP
   Human Resources & Community Relations  

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy 
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months, a 
project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched 
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source 
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance 
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project 
Team members are: 

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S
Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks
Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services
Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate
George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), 
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the 
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning 
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group.  This group 
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing 
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online 
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities.  
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary 
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best 
interests of the organization. 

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.  
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical 
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have 
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement 
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all 
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced 
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in 
service during this transition. 
 
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, 
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  The 
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two 
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we 
selected CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional 
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our 
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective 
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group will be 
communicating to Enron,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors 
about the new process.  

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are 
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF,s 
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be 
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed 
Services team.

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF,s Managed Services program includes:

? Vendor-neutral management model
? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized 
reporting
? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement
? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies 

Key Benefits

? More vendors working on each order from the outset ) faster access to 
available talent pools
? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively
? Online access to requisition status for users 
? Robust databases offering managers enhanced tracking and reporting of 
temporary usage and expenditures
? Standard and customized reporting capabilities -- online

	Brief commentary - October update
	This update sees one notable exit ) that of  Boxman.com from no.20 last time 
(August). Boxman had a good  management team, business model, cost control, 
and customer base,  but was a victim of over-ambition and negative investor 
sentiment in  the light of long or lengthening periods of losses. Others 
will  probably follow over the coming months.
	
	As with the last  update, though, there's more good news than bad ) new 
entries  include a number of strong b2b companies, including  
Sparesfinder.com, a young company with a great concept for cutting  costs for 
heavy industries.
	
	On a general note, The standard  of companies in the e-league (against which 
all are judged)  continues to improve, and scores have been adjusted to 
reflect the  improving average.
	
	There are still some notable exceptions  that warrant a place in the league, 
but from which we have been so  far unable to obtain sufficient data for the 
assessment, including  many continental European companies such as 
Chateauonline, and  Mercateo and other UK companies like Medexonline. 
	
	Future  developments will include more analysis of individual market sectors  
and the addition of selected company profiles ) we will provide more  details 
on this site over the next month.
	
	
	
	The Sunday Times and The Bathwick  Group would like to extend their thanks to 
the sponsors of the  e-League

		Jeff,

As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater 
involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on 
the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction 
was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   

In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to 
fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in 
August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and 
identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at 
least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both 
EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq 
Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between 
both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time 
was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq 
(Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 
sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for 
comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  
During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain 
points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed 
to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS 
concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate 
the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the 
development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   

EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with 
our relationship.

Kim,

Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, Dave
Spurlin "Owns" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.
All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your life
easier.

Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; My
reaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enron
and Compaq.  We are both exposed to potential unnecessary pitfalls that are
clearly evident in the original agreement.

We look forward to resolving this issue, amending this agreement, and moving
forward in the partnership between Enron and Compaq.

Sincerely,

Bob, David and Jeff,

Please find the following EMail as a piece of the EBS / Compaq history.   
This is the amendment language developed to address the five clarification 
points rasied during the EBS / Compaq meetings in August and September 
2000.   These meetings were held to gain mutual understanding and clearly 
identify the requirements of the January 2000 Product and Server Supply 
Agreement.  

Bob, I appreciated the honesty and perspective shared between us this 
morning.   I look forward to resolution of these perspectives. 

thanks,

Kim

	Chaz & Steve,

I was able to review our recently completed conference call w/BMC with 
Jennifer Medcalf.  

During the call, Bernie Goicoechea and Ann(e?) Munson expressed that during 
their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have 
attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has 
with regard to selection/use of BMC's products.  Bernie voiced that he hasn't 
been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net 
Works has, beyond what you and I know.  The BMC account team feels that 
without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely 
fashion.

The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are 
not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and 
not in writing).  Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the 
(Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) "...haven't 
kept up with the industry", and that they (Net Works) have some residual 
issues with the BMC account support in general.  Bottom Line, expressed by 
Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC 
software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.

You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnification 
and liquidated damages clauses being implemented.  Jennifer and I discussed 
this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context.  We have a 
possible alternative for you to consider:  perhaps EBS might provide a hedge 
for Net Works in the form of "advance purchase" of BMC product.

For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but 
needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total 
Enron purchases from BMC.  A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark 
with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC 
time to "click" might be this:  EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC 
software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other 
$2 million is used as a "future purchases" fund, in which EBS buys, but does 
not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current 
software...

THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of 
BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is 
delivered from/by BMC.  That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other 
business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they 
seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product 
when they need it in the future).  In addition, you secure the business with 
BMC right now.  I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the 
time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to 
you.

If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the 
meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on 
progress.

Thanks,

Jeff

	In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
 no right answer.  some examples are  strength or weakness in financial basis 
and index markets, customer flow, cash/futures spread, technical  analysis, 
storage projections, price action, etc.
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
 goal is to see how much he analyzes the fundamentals of the market
  weather - does candidate look at weather models such as american, european, 
and canadian operational runs or does he just     subscribe to  a weather 
service
  storage - has he built an aga forecasting model or does he just wait for 
others to tell him projections
  production - has candidate dug into eia production data, company specific 
drilling results, or state specific (such as texas railroad     commission 
reports)
  end of season storage number - has candidate built a longer term forecast 
of where we end up in storage.  
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?



John, 
Attached is a Bloomberg contract for Scott Neal, it will have to be executed 
by your department as our legal department cant sign off under this name.
I am still waiting for Bloomberg to send the paperwork to transfer yours.  

If you would like for these contracts to be sent to someone else in the 
future please let me know.

Thanks,
Julie

Do you have a simulation set up that will allow me to simulate trades by 
pushing a buy or sell button and will move the two way so i can try 
simulating actual market cicumstances?


saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate 
margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the 
front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter 
today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong 
on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk 
premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, 
down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish 
to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments 
for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was 
trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of 
probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that 
has to be reflected in h/j.

certainly doing their best. for cash to be at huge premiums and cold weather

gonna keep a huge premium in whats left of the winter strip vs summer, and 
they

I know it will be close to impossible to get out but I wanted to invite you 
to our Christmas party on Dec 20 here in NYC- we'd love if you came.  If not, 
in the new year, I hope we can set something up where you meet some of the 
new funds we are dealing and have some fun up here.

I met someone good to work with you guys at this last Super Saturday- David 
Larson- Berkeley- good derivatives, trading knowledge, personable.  I'll fax 
through resume- we are making him an offer for the analyst pool.

Thanks for all you help always,
CarolineJohn,
Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. 

First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock 
liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the 
plant, so that wouldn't help. 

Second, it seems there are more of these "portable pipeline" units floating 
around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas 
(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has 
one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. 
Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are 
about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic 
feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said 
yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the 
pipeline system in California. 

This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG 
consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that 
he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested 
in looking further into transporting LNG into California. 

Assuming that we could get a few "portable pipelines" and some trucks, there 
are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:

Location Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage 
(gal) Storage (mmcf)
Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2
LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2
Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8
LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      
Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2

Totals         26.48

Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The 
Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to 
providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with 
LNG fleet owners. 

I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting. >Sender: articles-email@ms1.lga2.nytimes.com

#1. 3 years
#2.  volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility.  volume 
probably averaging 25000 these days.  EOL volume averaging around 14000.   
Very high percent of market.   Current market conditions shows why our

Bryon Hoskins but need confirmation by you.  Would you mind giving us some 
feedback for #4 as well?  I could not find these numbers.  These are again 
going to be forwarded to Bain Capital, the potential equity investor in the

1. # of years of NYMEX visibility on the typical gas curve.

3 years

2. # of daily trades on NYMEX, in total and for Enron specifically.

102,492 daily trades on NYMEX (11/28/00)and ours amounts to 8,061 per day 
(usually around 10% daily NYMEX trades)

3. length and nature of "price discovery" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).

NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years. Liquidity of the market and 
proprietary market information equates to about 2 years after that with the 
remaining portion coming from more macro industry information.

4. trade volume data (# of daily trades as well) for each 5 year increment of
the gas curve beyond the NYMEX portion, in total and for Enron specifically. 

??

a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to 
switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing 
plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the 
gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at 
$1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test 
of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management 
keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too 
many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy 
prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  

funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 
friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each 
front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.  

what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas 
switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market 
too oversupplied to care?amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under 
such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year.   
will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually 
be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in 
f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec 
length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to 
some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts?

Re: trucking LNG to California - 

The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option 
for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a 
couple of reasons for this. 

First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only 
two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, 
affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military 
and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG 
Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck 
fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I 
was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is 
operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and 
Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern 
California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by 
ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and 
subsequent loading onto trucks.

Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The 
average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 
820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could 
deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely 
transfer it into storage. 

The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would 
be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under 
repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 
mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a 
time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, 
ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some 
reason. 

I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. 
I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located 
peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. 

Please let me know if you have specific questions.

of LNG terminal and facilities in the Northeast. How do they work? What are 
the logistics of transportation etc...


2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of  trucking LNG to CA.

I'm not sure if you have heard our fun news yet, but Rob and I are moving to
Boston at the first of the year!!

I will be working remotely for HBK while looking for something new up there.
Rob is continuing his career with Fidelity, though in a much more convenient
location.  The only downside is he will actually have to go into the office
every day!

We would love to see everybody before we leave, though it may not be
possible with the holidays.  I'll be back in Dallas once a week in January
and February, so we could plan to get together during one of those trips.
But before that time, Rob and I will be with a group of friends from HBK at
Martini Ranch on Thursday, December 14th right after work.  I'm sure we'll
be there late, given my love of martinis, so please stop by if you can.

Regardless, I really want to stay in touch with my Texas friends, so make
sure and send me your updated contact information if anything has changed in
the last year.  Please pass this on to people who I may have inadvertently
missed or I did not have their current email address.

Cheers,

By the way, our house is on the market right now, so if you know of anyone
looking, please tell them about it.  The address is 6815 Vivian Avenue,

A funny story:
Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of 
unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the 
exchange stopped trading for an hour.  
Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything 
was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange 
closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...

We could keep it between you and Mike. 

We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them 
who will need quicker execution.  I know you and Per have discussed the idea

Larry,

Thank you for getting back with me.  To answer your question:  It is looking 
more and more like the week of January 8th.  The meetings would be held using 
approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window:  the 9th, 10th, and 11th.  I have 
input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a 
tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th.  

I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) 
which each would be attending.  For example, you would probably attend both 
days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day 
meetings.  I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. 
certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems 
Engineer(s).

I will call you this week to get your input re:  who from your team would be 
going, and for which days.

Thank you,

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

Thank you,

MarkZ/F !!!!   wow.    Who would have thunk it.  Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as 
wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.  
Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it 
couldn't do it this year....
A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve 
told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than 
is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an 
Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling 
it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, 
cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage 
economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of 
winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.  
Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys 
are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it 
going to zero?

agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up

em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month

fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time 
is
busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with
calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have 
the
time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but
one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called 
impact
of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate 
at
all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.
   also will be curious how these "loan deals" by pipes work ouut. man these
guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash
hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in 
the
back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep
that part of the curve very strong agree?
  be cool my man-talk later

Carrie,

I hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

We would like to change the date for the Compaq Experience ENRON request I 
submitted online.   Originally the date was 12/13, we would like to 
reschedule for 12/14 for one hour in the afternoon.  Jennifer Stewart Medcalf

Mr. Thompson:

Thank-you for your time this morning as we reviewed progress on the 
Kinko's/Enron relationship and discussed how we might move forward with the 
appropriate individuals at Kinko's who could help us define "value 
propositions."
 
As we mentioned, we would like to have a conference call and/or meeting with 
Kinko's "solutions architects" who could work with us on further defining  
broadband and pulp & paper initatives.  If these discussions were held before 
the holidays, this would enable us to prepare both for the Experience Enron 
event which will be held January 5th, 2001 from 9-11 AM and for subsequent 
executive level meetings.

For example, someone who could answer questions regarding communication 
transit possibilities with kinkos.com and other broadband-related questions 
would be helpful in this endeavor.  Often, this information comes to us 
through the IT organization such as a direct report to the CIO or CTO.   
Additionally, someone from the Finance organization (direct report to the 
CFO) could address the following types of questions regarding Kinko's paper 
usage:

Of Kinko's overall costs, where does paper rank?
Does Kinko's have long-term (1-7 years), fixed pricing for copy paper?
Can Kinko's pass-through paper price increases on to its customers?

Mr. Thompson, I have taken the liberty of attaching the Meeting Minutes from 
the October 6th meeting as background information of our discussions.

Thank-you for your help.  I can be reached at:  #(713)-345-6541 and look 
forward to speaking soon.

AndreaPlease see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

Hey:
Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a 
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 
considering the scenario that's being painted.

johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.

   but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 
any
great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.
   guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling 
dry
up??



Hello:
It is the Blue Men Group.  Two friends highly recommend it.  It's in the 
Astor Theatre on Lafayette in the Village.

that you recommended we see?  And Michelle lives on W43rd, so it's not

I cant go take a pee w/o you sneaking up on me on ICE, ICE BABY.


The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It 
also details one  of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data  
contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no 
longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality of 
generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets 
around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were 
significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and 
deregulation at the state level.

LEGAL STUFF
The information contained in this newsletter is confidential and proprietary 
to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries.  It is intended for internal use only 
and should not be disclosed outside of Enron.Jennifer:

Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity 
with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James 
Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and 
cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it 
overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary 
King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?

Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ




Mr. Thompson:

Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband 
Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate 
broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike 
Rabon in the October 6th meeting. 

Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had 
expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.
IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.
IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.
Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about 
your storage strategy and growth.
Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.
Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to 
speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.
Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.


The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate 
unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals.     

We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.

If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.

Dear Mr.. Lavorato,

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

	John,

Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most
expeditious way.  I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that
looked like a good fit.  It was an asset evaluation and integration job for
Enron North America: job # 0000105886.

My primary strengths are:

Natural gas asset acquisition and management
Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and
derivatives execution
Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a
competitive reason to be     in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,
storage, physical presence
Good customer relations/account development
Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities
Stong negotiator

I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have
someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities.  Where I am coming
from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is
doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every
trend imaginable in leveraging itself.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Thanks.

Alan

my polling location is the knights of columbus hall. 

what exactly is a knight of columbus?Thad,

Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us 
which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual 
meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to 
choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the 
western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in 
NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th 
of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  

However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I 
need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' 
availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The 
meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for 
the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of 
meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible 
alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:

1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential 
solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and
2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to 
determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the 
(common) markets served:  "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" 
(channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as 
sales channels for each other's sales forces.

These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would 
include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss 
areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value 
propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a 
go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of 
some of the 
"EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item 
#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be 
addressed.

Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for 
your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to 
Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days 
synchronized with your executives'.  

Thank you,

Jeff

John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all.  
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

Brian,

We are not good to go here.  These are high profile traders and I do not want 
to install IE55 just for this chatting application.  I would like for 
Fangming to resolve whatever the problem is with IE5 first and go from there.

Again, sorry to be a pain and I understand your situation, but developers 
should not develop applications with unsupported dependencies.

So are we good to go to install IE 5.5?  From you email yesterday, I was 
under the impression that we were.  I understand that you guys need to keep 
the integrity of the system, but these guys really need this program ASAP.  

Again, if you need additional support, we can get that for you.  Just let me

Thanks,

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming

Jennifer,

I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably 
about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:

Based on the following, I would say this:

1)  BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works, 
and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully.
2)  Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or 
acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify 
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.
4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any 
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided 
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on 
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for 
information relative to "what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, 
Net Works?" from Net Works.
5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by 
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.  Period.

7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net 
Works' folks are concerned.

In the "I don't want any surprises" mode, I thought I'd give George a 
heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this 
morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team ("I 
don't see a problem here..."), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and 
implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for "credit", which any ENE business 
unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were 
likely to encourage Crowder to "lean on" Philippe (which I had recommended 
against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Jeff

I apologize if I didn't make myself clear over the phone.  There is a process 
that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with 
existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to 
install the application itself.

Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed 
with IE5 and provides real time chat.

I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at 
this time.

Regards,

Jennifer,
In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97 
figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference.  However, after 
speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case.  The CDs are not 
included in this figure.  

The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is 
currently being tabulated).

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's)   - $ 355.00
     This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing 
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included. 
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming - 
$ 770.00

So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8 
days. These are approximate figures only.

If you have any questions you can call Karen Hunter at X56228. or I can be 
reached at X55706.

I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed

EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would

JohnAdam:
Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

Hi John,

How are you today?  You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.
Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?  You
mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year
entail?  I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look
forward to seeing you again.  Do you have any tips on approaching the
interview process?  I have poured over the company website, and if you have
any tips I would love to hear them.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday.

Hello

I hear from Leonard that he had a very good meeting with you last week in
Houston.  We are hearing from quite a few people and the business is
beginning to flow.   On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the
signed contract is "on the way".

The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron's ability to
provide/supply natural gas to our company.  We consume quite a bit of
natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace.   I believe last
year we spent about $500,000.

As we both know the price of natural gas is rising.  It never hurts to check
and see if better deals are out there.  If this is of any interest, please
pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle.  The can contact
me first and then I will turn over to our person here.  Thanks

can you find out if the tech group has scheduled installation of a dsl line 
in my apartment?It's funny the spreads in gas.  First, in gas, you can play the seasonality 
game.  Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back.  No, of course not.  But in 
crude, m/n at .10 back is normal.  definitely a game as you try to keep month 
on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads 
and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.  
that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.  
when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt 
month.  i can't remember w/o looking at charts.  it's always the mentality 
of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter.  i think that's 
why the winter spreads are a piece.  the z/f/g fly is interesting.  i think 
z/f can and will settle backw.  just a high prob it goes cantango first.
Still seeing sellside interest in term.  definitely a result of pira.  will 
probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them 
and watches the front of the curve.  previous to that conference, the 
producers just didnt want to sell anything.  tired of writing us a big check 
every month.
so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so 
i can work at home at night.  it's really my only time to sit and think 
without the phones and eol going crazy.  they better pay me for the decline 
in my lifestyle .

what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again 
the
numbers but pretty sure they said  +3 bcf by dec. ill let you  know/its been
along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know
this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering
if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for
only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.
    some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk 
too
they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing
deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be 
hard
to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel
period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds 
until
all the length bails.
    your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px
to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at 
pira
including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a
win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.
   fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on
natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you 
be
careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will
be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs
negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to
natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on 
oil
side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im
surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks
getting hit lately??
   good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you 
some
interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up.
    by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my
biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next
summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.

We need you -- for the Management Conference video

We are working with the Office of the Chairman in preparing a video that 
celebrates how Enron has reinvented itself many times over in the last 15 
years, which is the theme of this year's Enron Management Conference.  We 
will be videotaping members of the Enron Executive Committee this week who 
will be sharing and swapping stories with each other about Enron's past.  
Then we will fast forward to today -- that's where you come in.  We want each 
of you to talk about what you and your group are doing right now that 
represent how Enron continues to change and reinvent itself.

We will be videotaping October 24 and 25 in EB-50M05.   Please call or e-mail 
Marge Nadasky on Ext. 36631 as soon as possible to schedule a time that works 
best for you on either of these days.  We expect the taping will only take 20 
minutes or so.

Again, your comments will help make this video fun and informative.  Thanks 
for your participation.



We both thank you

Savita:
A couple of issues:

1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis 
child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system?

2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they 
meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas 
dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually 
I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm 
restricted right now by issue #1.

Please advise,
JohnOh yea, I always get those two places confused.


pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer 
selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most 
selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect 
these days.  Too much, probably.
The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in 
natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March 
and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude.  
These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there 
were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made 
a penny.  
Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe.

cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out know
who's doing what! im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01
and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that to
heart. here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonna
be up 1-1.5 bcf by year end. does increased deliverabilty mean these winter
sprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be more
concerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese will
not be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius your
thots-i maybe thinking too much but makes some sense to me-have a good weekend
johnny.
pira says decm 01 prod up 3 bcf y on y!



of course...

Jennifer, I'm not so territorial that fire hydrants and trees are on my 
priority list, but I thought that I was doing my job OK on this.  If I read 
Crowder's FWD to Kim in a certain "tone", it appears to me that they feel I 
am overstepping.  I'm sure there is a better way for me to coordinate and 
facilitate these meetings, and do so in such a "tone" that Jim doesn't react 
the way I sense he did,  so I'll be coming to you to discuss, OK? 

On a lighter note (I hope), I hope your NY trip went well, and I'll see you 
tomorrow!

Thank you,

Jeff

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

I'm in the process of booking the Avaya Briefing Center and need to know how
many people from Enron will be visiting our headquarters.  I've asked for
the afternoon of December 13th and all day on the 14th.

We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including

have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways.  I

that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me 
know if this causes you a problem. Colin Bailey is in Houston next week if 
you need or want to know any of the detail.

JohnYea, problem is I left at noon to catch my flight, but Marc had a later 
flight because NY is closer to Columbus than here. Right after I left, the 
market got very busy and Marc decided to stay at work and not go.  So that 
sucked.

John,

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from 
you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would like 
to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily 
is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) 
- so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your 
offer.

Hey - It's me!  Any luck with the tickets?????  Just curious if there any way

appreciate it.  You know how much I love the Counting Crows and last time 
they were in town someone was going to take me but the plans fell 
through..........Thanks!!!!!!!

Jennifer 

I was long 4000 X @ 4902, then I switched it from X to F at the same price.  
I switched it at 5000, but it puts me into the F at a price basis of 4902.  
Sorry for the confusion.

	Adam:
Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly 
identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I 
would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's 
happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the 
LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, 
the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I 
still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals 
and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  
The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  
It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Dear Mr. Arnold,

 It was nice to meet you yesterday at the
information session.  Thank you for the dinner last night.
I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in
a more relaxed setting.

 During out conversation yesterday, I was confused
about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of
your time on the phone with Traders in New York.  When
you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards
Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron
Online?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,
is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,
or is it meant to bypass traders completely.

Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward
to talking with you again when you come to campus for
interviews.

Cordially,

Adam

We are still on for drinks on the 19th.  You have called the market very well 
since you started sending me updates.  Unfortunately for both of us, a couple 
of good calls does not a soothsayer make.  Thus, keep sending me your updates

I hope you know I was just fishing for a reaction on the phone before.  I
assumed we would discuss a potential relationship when I'm in Houston on the
19th.  We're still on for drinks after work, right?  By then, you should
have a comfort level with the quality of my work.  I think the analysis I've
given you has been quite accurate as to market turns and price behavior.  It
would be helpful if I had some idea of how you trade/view the market.  Are
you mainly day-trading or do you hold positions for several days/weeks?
That way I can structure my comments in order to best serve your interests.

Jeff,

Per our conversation this morning, I will list the items in question.  I am
also forwarding this to Kelli Wallin in our accounting department to follow
up on as well.

* ACCOUNTING:  Please see that all service charges were posted as 18%,
per contract
* JEFF: I will fax you the comp ticket showing the 1 hour reception
posted to The Woodlands House account.
* ACCOUNTING: Please fax Jeff the back up for the package handling
charges. $451.35
* ACCOUNTING: Please adjust (1) wireless mouse charge for a total of
$156.41
* JEFF: In regards to the lunch charges, we charged a day guest rate
to include lunch in The Woodlands Dining Room @ $57.00 for  40 day
attendees.  You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package.  However,
when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box
lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.  Thus, 80+40=120 - 100
(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The
Woodlands Dining Room.  We billed you for the total amount of persons over
the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.
* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.  Enron had a guarantee of
120 attendees.  We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.  This particular
day, (5) breakouts were ordered.  The audio visual in the additional
breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.
Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.

Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as
possible in order to remit for payment.  Please feel free to call me should
you have further questions.  Thank you for your business!

John:
?
The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing.? My 
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural 
appears to be waning at present.? Volume on this rally is  poor, particularly 
since yesterday was a decent day to the upside.? The  market appears to be 
using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels.? If  we are at these same 
price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely  bullish.? Right 
here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.?  Recommend a neutral 
stance short-term on natural.? Bigger picture is still  very bullish.? 
However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would  call horizontal 
price action to set the stage for a big move to the  upside.
?
Let me know if this stuff is useful for you.? I certainly  don't want to 
waste your time.? In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have something to 
pass along, let me know.? I don't know how often you  check/see your e-mail.? 
Thanks,

I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill 
Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an 
extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone "who thinks outside the box".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years 
and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.  
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within 
reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.

I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that 
Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This 
was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing 
models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since 
been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  

Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting 
credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.
Thanks,

	Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product 
priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really 
shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the 
predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.  

One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new 
product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated 
basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated 
basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec 
Nymex.  Any ideas?Jeff:

I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, 
bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level 
than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  
Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different 
than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I 
think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very 
impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.  

Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car 
thief.

I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how 
you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so 
dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could 
produce that effect.  
The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into 
the winter.

consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows  is a negative 
for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type  of strength 
pattern today.? It is not a "9" type topping pattern, but one  that normally 
comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would  suggest a 
potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major  
importance.
?
I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October  19.? Are you 
interested in meeting so that I may show in much greater  detail what the 
work is doing and how it can enhance your activity?? Let me  know if that day 
works for you.? Thanks,

John,
I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday.  If, as we
discussed yesterday, you have time to get out after work, I'd like to

Hi:
The big money making floor?   I don't think I like that.  Too much 
pressure...what happens if we screw up?

I went to the website and clicked on the link but all I got was a mess of 
characteres and symbols.  Any ideas how I fix it?
John


Jennifer,
After the Universal-Enron conference call with Elyse Kalmans and Misha 
Siegel, we discovered the following:

The majority of the JPI is for-profit and therefore Community Relations 
cannot be a sponsoring party.
Elyse recommended I contact Mark Palmer to discuss the sponsorship and the 
value tied to EMS, Weather, Plastics & Credit.
Universal was hesitant to comment on dollar amounts for the sponsorship but 
noted $250K would be the lowest amount for the JPI Virtual Institute. 

I wanted to consult your advice as to what tactics would be best at this 
point.  Is Mark Palmer definitely the correct contact?  Would you prefer to 
contact him on this front?  

Thanks.
Colleencan you please add this

Greg:
The guy from MG whom I spoke to about clearing was Alfred Pennisi, VP of 
Operations.  He's out of NY.   He indicated his clearing costs were $3.10 
versus the $4.50-5.00 I'm paying now.Dave:
A couple things about the limit orders:

1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise.  

2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000.  

3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

Thx,
JohnPlease remove me from your mailing list

NACORE Houston Chapter Luncheon Meeting

An excellent opportunity to learn
and network with your corporate real estate peers.

Topic:  THE DOWNTOWN ARENA

Place:  The Houston City Club
            Nine Greenway Plaza
            1 City Club Drive, Houston, TX

Cost:   $25.00 (includes buffet luncheon)

RSVP using the attached form
or call Tammy Mullins at 713-739-7373 x 115



 - Notice91300.doc

I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and 
maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is 
$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing 
ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher 
clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.  

Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El 
Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long 
futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin 
costs.   if you have a minute sometime today, please stop by.

It will be interesting to see what volumes of metal they 
purchase/use...especially steel, given my meeting results from yesterday's 
meeting w/Tim Battaglia and Art Bieser of Enron Industrial Markets (Steel

I look forward to working with your team  on this.

Mark Frevert / Mark HaedickeMeeting Minutes: Bristol Babcock, Pagosa Energy/Well Master, EBS, and GSS
Meeting Purpose:  Business overview, solutions identification/brainstorming
Date: 12/1/00

Enron

EBS Attendee:
Anthony Gilmore
Global Strategic Sourcing Attendee: 
Jeff Youngflesh

Bristol Babcock
Kevin Finnan
Jim Griffeth

Pagosa Energy/Well Master
Rob Bender


DISCUSSION POINTS:

1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, with 
placement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer, 
corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the data 
transmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be of 
interest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energy 
"unified solutions" (quotes are mine - JKY) for the gas industry.  NOTE:  
this could take a longer term to reach the necessary "critical status", due 
to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow 
generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.
1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales 
of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network 
capacity.  (a "sell-through" effect for EBS)

2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions 
to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that 
a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.  NOTE:  this could 
accelerate to the necessary "critical status", bringing to EBS more solutions 
demand due to the addition of "sell-to".  The "sell-through" effect would be 
present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a 
sales "channel"), as well as EBS "sell-to" BBI & Pagosa for their own 
internal consumption of bandwidth.
____________________________________________________________________


ACTION ITEMS:  
1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services 
the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's 
(Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.

2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would 
be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to 
execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas 
well-head).

3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process, 
attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand: (usage patterns/volume/etc.) 
at Bristol and/or Pagosa.
3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) at 
Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from 
well-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.

4)  Enron GSS to contact Ron Smith - waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallel 
opportunity (gas / water analog).

5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways of 
getting the TeleFlow CDPD data onto the EBS "Enron Intelligent Network"

Next Meeting: TBD

Please let me know if I've missed anything.

Dear Jeff:

It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith and
Kevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.  Perhaps by now you have had an
opportunity to review the  http://wells.pagosaenergy.com web site and
look at aspects of the "demo" section.  This is a very dynamic program
with changes, upgrades, and customization taking place all the time to
meet the individual needs of our customers.

There may well be a good fit here as we are seeking ever faster means of
communication and will be requiring a substantial infrastructure not
only for communications but for data base hosting as well.  While yet in
its infancy we have received very positive feedback and interest from
numerous oil and gas companies in the industry.  An alliance with Enron
to help us on the road to becoming the "Microsoft" of oil and gas well
automation would be a very alluring prospect.  I would like to keep a
dialog going between us to scope out areas of mutual benefit for our two
companies where such an alliance would make sense.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
Rob Bender,
President - PagosaEnergy.com

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Thank you for your reply.  I know you are doubly busy with your being on the 
road this week, just prior to a vacation.  Your answer below is perfect!  
Bob, you and your team have been very supportive of our efforts to assist EBS 
with BMC, and you have done all that we could have asked!  I wanted you to 
know that we really appreciate your support (I especially do, as a "late 
arrival" to this situation)!  Thank you again for all of the help!

Subject: data standards


Dear AEDC Member,

One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena
is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  This
standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic
developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and
examining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and
more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more
comparable than ever before.

A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to
see how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25
tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the
bottom of the page will access the additional tables.

You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use
the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into
a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for
the standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the
standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which
approach works best for you.

Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic
development profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many
areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't
received the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to
tell their story.

If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for
notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the
standards and their use.
